# AMPLIFY Invent - API Customer hackathons
What we will be doing
We are holding hackathons with customers and Axway hackathon for API Management. The goal of the hackathon is to meet together and to hack against Axway’s API Management v7 solution so that we work together to address improvements in the following areas:
- Team development (multiple people working on Gateway configuration)
- DevOps automation 

Please feel free to propose project ideas in the “Project suggestions” section below. 
We will select projects to hack on closer to the date and split up into teams.

## Next hackathon
Paris: September 17th - 19th 2019


## Project suggestions

1. Improved certificate management by allowing PEM files (or java keystore) to be in the Gateway’s configuration
2. Break up the monolith configuration of the API Gateway into yaml files from the zipped monolithic XML files
3. Adopt a test framework for API Gateway change validation so that a quality gate can be put in place in a CI/CD
4. A Quick filter is a versioned artifact (zip file) that is packaged inside a FED. Easy to create (via Policy Studio), easy to add to project from SCM or online marketplace. 
Quick filter contains four items – metadata (name, version), field definitions, UI layout, javascript that gets executed) 
5. Introduce OpenTracing to the API Gateway to provide end to end visibility in production
6. Ability to configure their relative paths using a yaml file (they actually have only the / relative path and the yaml file is loaded at run time and cached and contains all the relative paths needed). 
7.  A way to generate .env files from yaml or json configuration files.  - scenario where you have multiple environmetents.   (https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/apigw-maven-plugin)
8. Enhance Swagger Promote
- Import an API and client certificates for both front-end and back-end APIs
- Build REST wrapper around Maven in order to be able to integrate with other services
- Create an extension for Visual Studio Code that calls the REST wrapper to automoatically publish to the gateway.
